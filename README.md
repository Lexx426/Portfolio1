Welcome, here is my portfolio with the intent to show off two main things: my skills and personality. Resumes can only capture so much, a very technical and professional way of displaying oneself. It is a very important way to showcase those hard skills, but it is very difficult to show one's character in a resume. I created a portoflio with two goals in mind: an evergoing project where I can learn new and exciting front end skills and also showing who I really am. Character is so important and often overlooked or just not shown. I hope that whoever comes across my portfolio are able to see the time that went into this project while also feeling as if they got to know a bit more about the person behind the name.
